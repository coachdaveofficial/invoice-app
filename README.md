# Invoyz

## A web app to create invoices tailored for any service industry

### Current Demo Features:

* Manage your customer contact list
* Manage the services you offer and easily create estimates for inquiring customers
* Monitor the status of your company's invoices

### Future Additions

This current stack for this app consists entirely of Flask, JavaScript, jQuery, and Boostrap HTML.
However, I will be refactoring certain user flows with the inclusion of React.js in the near future to allow for more comprehensive sorting, searching, and overall a better user experience.
